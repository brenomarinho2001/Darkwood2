# Noise Generator and Shader Examples

This is a Godot 3.2 project containing two scenes:

Seamless noise generator scene - Here you can setup a noise texture, play around with its parameters and save the texture as a png (will be saved to the /capture/ folder).

Shader example scene - Here you'll find three example uses of noise in a 2D shader. It's not too crazy, just very simple examples to spark imagination.


## How to use?

Best is to watch the [**YouTube video**](https://youtu.be/IvOfx-kbqac) explaining the creation of this example project, the generator and the combination process of different noise textures.
